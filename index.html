            <h2 class="testimonial-text"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i> I have been very fortunate to manage Isabella over the past year and during that, she has been a Recruiter in my team and she is without a doubt one of the best Sourcers/Recruiters that I have ever worked with. Isabella worked across the Full Stack, Backend, ML, Mobile & Enterprise Engineering pipelines, hiring into multiple locations, and was able to far exceed her hiring goal, maintaining an incredibly high pass-through rate. Isabella has been an incredible partner to our Engineering Managers/Directors, enabling them to hire the top 1% of talent across the world, specifically within London & Singapore. I know that I speak on behalf of every Engineering Partner that Isabella has worked with, that she has incredible knack for getting things done efficiently and smoothly. I would love to work with Isabella again and I highly recommend her to any organisation, and I know that she'll have an instant impact.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></h2>

            <h2 class="testimonial-text"><i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>Isabella was a recruiter in my org focusing on senior Android hiring in our Netherlands office. A couple of things that Isabella did well during her time here are embracing ambiguity and execution. We had many challenges and goal adjustments throughout Isabella's tenure, but she had a very determined approach to her work which made it easy to navigate no matter the circumstances. I felt she was able to apply her understanding of technical recruitment from previous roles with ease as she would consistently meet her weekly funnel targets. I would recommend Isabella for any type of technical recruiting role and would be excited to work with her again in the future!<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i></h2>

              She is also able to take the budget, time frame, and working culture requirements into consideration, and with her understanding of the talent market, she was also a good adviser to me for the offer structuring. It was very pleasant and
              efficient working experience with Isabella. <i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i> </h2>
